# Multiple Downloader

The multiple downloader is a collection of extensions for different browsers that adds a
multiple download feature to the UI of each. The multiple download action is available
whenever a page explicitly contains downloadable content, as determined by the presence of
the "download" attribute in some of its anchor tags.

This should really be a built-in feature of browsers, since the "download" attribute is
defined in HTML5.


## Try it Out
The project is not yet released but build snapshots for select browsers exist:

- [Chrome beta](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/com-msiops-static/multidownload/chrome/multidl-snap.crx) (download then drag onto extensions page)
