# Multiple Downloader

The multiple downloader is a collection of extensions for different browsers adding a
multiple download feature to the UI of each. The multiple download action is available
whenever a page explicitly contains downloadable content, as determined by the presence of
the "download" attribute in some of its anchor tags.

This should really be a built-in feature of browsers, since the "download" attribute is
defined in HTML5.

## Try it Out
